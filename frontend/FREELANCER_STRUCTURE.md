## 🚀 Routes

### Main Freelancer Routes
- `/freelancer` - Main freelancer dashboard
- `/freelancer/dashboard` - Dashboard (alternative)
- `/freelancer/services` - Services management
- `/freelancer/bookings` - Bookings management

### Role Detection
The UserContext automatically detects the current role based on the URL path:
- `/freelancer/*` → Freelancer role
- `/client/*` → Client role
- `/admin/*` → Admin role
